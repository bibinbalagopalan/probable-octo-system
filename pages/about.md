## Our Genesis: Born from Crisis, Driven by Purpose

Jeevadhara emerged during the challenging times of the COVID-19 lockdown, when education systems worldwide were disrupted. What began as a small initiative of like-minded educational experts conducting free classes via Google Meet and Zoom has blossomed into a movement dedicated to democratizing education.

<div class="static-highlight-box">
<h3>Our Founding Vision</h3>
<ul class="static-list">
<li>Make entrance-based education completely free and accessible</li>
<li>Bridge the gap between privileged and underprivileged students</li>
<li>Leverage technology to reach every corner of the country</li>
<li>Create a community of learners and educators</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Who We Are

Jeevadhara is a collective of passionate educational experts, dedicated doctors, innovative research assistants, and committed educators who believe that quality education is a fundamental right, not a privilege. We come together with a shared vision: to eliminate financial and geographical barriers that prevent deserving students from achieving their academic dreams.

<h3>Our Unique Approach</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional coaching centers that focus on profits, we focus on impact. Every expert volunteers their time because they believe in our mission of educational equality.</p>

## Our Evolution

### The Lockdown Beginning

During the pandemic, we recognized the growing educational divide. While some students continued their studies through expensive online platforms, many were left behind. We started with free sessions on video conferencing platforms, reaching students who had nowhere else to turn.

### Building a Community

What started as emergency online classes evolved into a structured learning ecosystem. We developed comprehensive study materials, regular test series, and personalized mentorship programs - all completely free of cost.

### Today's Platform

We've transformed from makeshift online classes to a robust digital platform, but our core mission remains unchanged: providing high-quality entrance exam preparation to every student, regardless of their financial background.
